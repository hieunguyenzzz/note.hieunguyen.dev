# I watch the Notting Hill for 10 times

There is nothing special about the movie I have to be admit at first, my friends are very amazed when I can watch the same movie over and over, 10 times. And I don't know how to explain

It would be exaggerate when I say the movie has nothing special, The movie is a love story between an average  book seller William and an super famous actor Anna Scott ( Junia Rebert). Anna was shopping in a shop by the time William dicovered a book thief and he handled the situation very charming. Then Anna finished her purchase and walk out the door but it does not stop there, incidentally 20m later William went out to buy a coffee, he hits on Anna at the corner and by the way throw all the hot cup of coffee on her. He was politely asking Anna to come by his house very close from there to changes and she has no choice other than going with him, after little talk little chat they ends up kissing before leaving - weird but nice.

I am not going to expose all the detail of the movie here, as well as the ends. I just wanna say that the movie is special because the director does not want to make it special, a movie without plot. he seem to tend to keep the movie slow and soft, little fun here and there - just enough laughing but all are brilliant. There is nice song in the middle of the movie perform by Ronan Keating - when you say nothing at all - when William and Anna are break into a forbidden garden and kissing. It makes the whole movie was like a song

I remember the conversation at the end of the movie when they about broke up, "I am just a girl, standing in front of the boy, asking him to love me" that was classic. I was watching the movie over and over again just to see this part of the movie. I don't know why but it impress me even more than when Jack hold Rose hand on the prow of titanic. There is no movie could ever do that again - classic. or maybe it was just me
